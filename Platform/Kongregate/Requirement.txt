There we go, that's all fine and working now!

There is still just one last thing, and then I'm good to approve the game for publishing! For a user that isn't logged in, the main menu of the page should have a sign in/register button that launches the registration popup. The game should then acknowledge that the user is signed in, and show their appropriate progress. 

Once that's complete, the next thing we'd need from you is a few assets so we can run ads for the game on the site. They would be 2 icons, one at 66x66 and another at 93x74, as well as an 8-12 word description of the game.

Thanks,
